# Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicle (AUV) Project
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This project's end of life was Fall 2023**
## Objective
The objective of our project is to improve a current design for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).  The AUV in its current state is not autonomous, its control system is not ergonomic, and it is not waterproof.  We have identified waterproofing gaps and have solutions to fix these gaps.  The current control system, which is based on eight independently operated potentiometers, will be replaced with a computer-based system which takes inputs from a computer and outputs them as motor signals.  Further steps to improve the AUV control system is to bring an inboard computer into the AUV to untether it from the surface.
## Results
The project ended well; however, concluded with: 
* Thethered Communications were stable over Serial Link.
* Non-Thethered activites were limited to Air.
* Control Systems were effective for manual control.
* Motor systems were able to have Continous Drivability.
* Minimal autonomous ability.
