Local Computer is defined as the Raspberry Pi Compute Unit within the AUV.
It's goal is to decode Serial commands from the Remote Computer.
Then translate said command to a thrust PWM signal for movement.
Future plans include giving more generalized waypoint commands and an interal model of the auv.
Additional sensors will be added to craft to obtain general health and information of the surroundings.
