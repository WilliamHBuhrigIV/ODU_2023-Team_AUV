In our design we are implementing ASME Standard Y14.5 for geometry dimensions and tolerances, 
the Parker Manual for O ring usage and implementation, and the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code Section X: Fiber-Reinforced Plastic Pressure Vessels. ASME Y14.5 is used as our designs 
will need interpretation by other engineers and ensuring succeeding teams understand the nature 
of the designs is crucial to the projects success. The Parker Manual is being utilized as O rings 
are the main waterproofing system used on the AUV and ensuring proper use of O rings will increase 
the waterproofness of the AUV. Finally, the ASME BPVC Section X is used as the AUV is a reverse 
pressure vessel. Although material strengths for resin additive manufacturing components are lower 
than glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastics, the guidance the code provides can improve the 
hull strength of any additions to the AUV.
