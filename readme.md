# Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicle (AUV) Project
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This project's end of life was Fall 2023**
## Objective
The objective of our project is to improve a current design for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).  The AUV in its current state is not autonomous, its control system is not ergonomic, and it is not waterproof.  We have identified waterproofing gaps and have solutions to fix these gaps.  The current control system, which is based on eight independently operated potentiometers, will be replaced with a computer-based system which takes inputs from a computer and outputs them as motor signals.  Further steps to improve the AUV control system is to bring an inboard computer into the AUV to untether it from the surface.
## Results
The project ended well; however, concluded with: 
* Finished with Fully Water-Resistant Design. Which allowed project to start underwater testing.
* Created a system of Stable IPv4 Thethered Communications.
* Created Control Systems effective for manual control.
* Non-Thethered activites were limited to Air.
* Motor systems were able to have Continuous Thrust via GPIO PWM Driver.
* PWM Driver issues due to maximum power draw for Signal Input to Motor.
* Ended with Minimal autonomous ability, but with an Architecture capable of improvement.
* Didn't Get improved by future teams, as design was scraped for a more traditional cartesian design.
